Create links to florae.it: the Italian flora made by Sandro Pignatti available on line.
	
== Description ==

Create your botanical blog, put the plant scientific name in title and voila: in the top of your article there is a link to florae.it.

This plugin uses an external service [Florae.it](https://florae.it/).

[Florae.it](https://florae.it/) is the on-line version of the Italian flora made by Sandro Pignatti in 1982 and has nearly 10.000 plants with textual description and illustrations.

I have realized the site, collected the data and made freely available.

More info about privacy and personal data [Florae.it Privacy](https://www.florae.it//privacy.php).

The users are mainly Italian speaking and the privacy is written in Italian; this is a resume in English.

[Florae.it](https://florae.it/) collects information about browser, language, IP address and request time for statistical evaluation only and prevent unwanted uses.

Personal data of registered users, plant photos a their location is used only to evaluate the authenticity of the plant identification.
